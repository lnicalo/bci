Help file of Semi-supervised Affinity Propagation clustering (Version 1.0)

  Affinity propagation clustering (AP) is a clustering algorithm proposed in "Brendan J. Frey and Delbert Dueck. Clustering by Passing Messages Between Data Points. Science 315, 972 (2007)". It has some advantages: speed, general applicability, and suitable for large number of clusters. 

  Semi-supervised AP improves AP by: embedding Silhouette indices into the programs of AP to supervise the running of AP, so that the AP will give its optimal clustering solution. 

  The programs of semi-supervised AP are suitable for the person who has interests in studying or improving AP algorithm, and then the semi-supervised AP may be an example for reference. You are suggested to try another improved Affinity Propagation clustering --- "Adaptive Affinity Propagation clustering", available from:

  Your tests and comments are helpful and welcome (E-mail: wangkjun@yahoo.com).
